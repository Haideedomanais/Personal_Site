<p>Hi! My name is Haidee. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education in 2015 and am now shifting to the IT industry. To build my skills and gain a solid foundation, I am currently taking a diploma course in Information Technology at the University of the Philippines Open University. I work as a Fulfillment Coordinator at LexisNexis France, where I manage orders, track data, and coordinate processes. This role has given me experience with systems and automation, which connects to my IT studies. I aim to apply my technical skills to improve workflows and contribute to digital solutions in the future.</p>
